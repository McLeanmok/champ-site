    Project Map
    Github repository link - https://github.com/McLeanmok/champ-site
    At the root level are files that house system styling.
        utils.css - All the variables and utility classes for ChampCSS
        reset.css - general reset file for the website
        components.css - atomic level website components 
    patterns - any repeatable sections/templates that are used repeatedly across the website 
    pages - page specific styling 


    STANDARDS
        - if you need to add a new page that requires custom work, please add a new file in pages
        - if you need to add a bit of reusable styling, it's best to add it into utils.css 
        - if a section might be reusable, better to make a pattern out of it. In that case, add a pattern. I am using Vancouver Island names of towns, and Gulf islands. If you run out, move to cities in British Columbia.
